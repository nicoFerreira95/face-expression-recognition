# Face Expression Recognition using Deep Learning

This project aims to recognize facial expressions using deep learning techniques. The dataset used in this project is the [Facial Expression Recognition Challenge dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/data), which contains 48x48-pixel grayscale images of faces labeled with one of seven facial expressions: angry, disgust, fear, happy, sad, surprise, and neutral.

## Requirements
The following libraries are required to run the code in this repository:

* Python 3
* TensorFlow
* Keras
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* OpenCV
